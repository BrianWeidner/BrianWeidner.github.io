    <H1>About My Work</H1>

        <p>Im currently a lifeguard at the Old Town YMCA, however, im persuing an internship oppertunity so who knows how long ill be working there. During the summers im a camp councellor at the Small Point Summer School in Small Point ME. In the mornings I work with the "explorrers" which are our youngest group ranging from ages 3 and a half to 7. In the afternoon I teach sailing on 420's, Lazers, and Opties. For a side job im also the captain of the Small Point Yacht Clubs flagship boat. For them I run sailboat races for the one design "SmallPointer" sailboat. Below is a picture of me on the SPYC Comittee Boat!</p>
